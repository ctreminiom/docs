# Infrastructure as Code

A fundamental principle of DevOps is to treat infrastructure the same way developers treat code. The Application code has a defined format and syntax. If the code is not written according to the rules of the programming language, applications cannot be created. The Code is stored in version management or source control system that logs a history of code development, changes, and bug fixes. When code is compiled or built into applications, we expect a consistent application to be created, and the build is repeatable and reliable. Also, it's a way to manage:

* Configurations
* Provisioning
* Deployments

The Tool from software development applied to infrastructure:

* Version Control.
* Testing.
* CI / CD pipelines.

### Benefits

* **Cost reduction**: Speaks to less time spent by people and effort
* **Speed:** Automation-enabled speed through hast execution with more visibility.
* **Less risk:**  Less chance of human error, manual misconfiguration which increases reliability and decreases downtime and improves security.
