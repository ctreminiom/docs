## What's infrastructure as Code

In the past, managing IT infrastructure was a hard job. System administrators had to manually manage and configure all of the hardware and software that was needed for the applications to run.

However, in recent years, things have changed dramatically. Trends like [cloud computing](https://stackify.com/cloud-monitoring/) revolutionized—and improved—the way organizations design, develop, and maintain their IT infrastructure.

One of the critical components of this trend is called “infrastructure as code,” and it’s what we’re going to talk about today.

_Infrastructure as code is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools._

As far as definitions go, this one isn’t bad, but it’s somewhat wordy. Let’s try and rewrite a simpler version:

_Infrastructure as code \(IaC\) means managing your IT infrastructure using configuration files._

* **One-Time Work:** You'll need to invest a fraction of time to create the infrastructure provision one time 
* **Re-User Template:** The Terraform template can be easily shared with multiples stages.
* **Quick & Fast:** The creation of the infrastructure is fully automated and it'll take minutes or seconds.
* **Tracked for Audit:** The Terraform templates are stored on a repository management tool \(GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc\).

## Traditional Way

* A lack of documentation.
* The changes are **manual**.
* I might not have.
* Scalability problems
