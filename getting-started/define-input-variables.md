# ðŸ§º Define Input Variables

You now have enough Terraform knowledge to create useful configurations, but the examples so far have used hard-coded values. Terraform configurations can include variables to make your configuration more dynamic and flexible.

### Set the instance name with a variable <a href="#set-the-instance-name-with-a-variable" id="set-the-instance-name-with-a-variable"></a>

The current configuration includes a number of hard-coded values. Terraform variables allow you to write configuration that is flexible and easier to re-use.

Add a variable to define the instance name.

Create a new file called `variables.tf` with a block defining a new `instance_name` variable.

```hcl
variable "instance_name" {
  description = "Value of the Name tag for the EC2 instance"
  type        = string
  default     = "ExampleAppServerInstance"
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Terraform loads all files in the current directory ending in `.tf`, so you can name your configuration files however you choose.
{% endhint %}

In `main.tf`, update the `aws_instance` resource block to use the new variable. The `instance_name` variable block will default to its default value ("ExampleAppServerInstance") unless you declare a different value.

```diff
 resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
   ami           = "ami-08d70e59c07c61a3a"
   instance_type = "t2.micro"

   tags = {
-    Name = "ExampleAppServerInstance"
+    Name = var.instance_name
   }
 }
```

### Apply your configuration <a href="#apply-your-configuration" id="apply-your-configuration"></a>

Apply the configuration. Respond to the confirmation prompt with a `yes`.

{% code fullWidth="true" %}
```shell-session
$ terraform apply

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_instance.app_server will be created
  + resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
      + ami                          = "ami-08d70e59c07c61a3a"
      + arn                          = (known after apply)
##...

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

aws_instance.app_server: Creating...
aws_instance.app_server: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
aws_instance.app_server: Still creating... [20s elapsed]
aws_instance.app_server: Still creating... [30s elapsed]
aws_instance.app_server: Still creating... [40s elapsed]
aws_instance.app_server: Creation complete after 50s [id=i-0bf954919ed765de1]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```
{% endcode %}

Now apply the configuration again, this time overriding the default instance name by passing in a variable using the `-var` flag. Terraform will update the instance's `Name` tag with the new name. Respond to the confirmation prompt with `yes`.

{% code fullWidth="true" %}
```shell-session
$ terraform apply -var "instance_name=YetAnotherName"
aws_instance.app_server: Refreshing state... [id=i-0bf954919ed765de1]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  ~ update in-place

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_instance.app_server will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
        id                           = "i-0bf954919ed765de1"
      ~ tags                         = {
          ~ "Name" = "ExampleAppServerInstance" -> "YetAnotherName"
        }
        # (26 unchanged attributes hidden)




        # (4 unchanged blocks hidden)
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

aws_instance.app_server: Modifying... [id=i-0bf954919ed765de1]
aws_instance.app_server: Modifications complete after 7s [id=i-0bf954919ed765de1]

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 1 changed, 0 destroyed.
```
{% endcode %}

Setting variables via the command-line will not save their values. Terraform supports many ways to use and set variables so you can avoid having to enter them repeatedly as you execute commands.
